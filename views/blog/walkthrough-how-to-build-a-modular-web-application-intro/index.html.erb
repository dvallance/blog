	<h1>Introduction: Walk-through, How to Build a Modular Web Application with Ruby</h1>
	<div class="post-body">
		<p>I&#8217;ve decided to document the development process of my next little &#8220;learning&#8221; project. There are some concepts I wish to test out and some technologies I wish to get more familiar with.</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>A walk-through approach as I build a ruby web application. The application will attempt to be very modular; separating areas of concern into smaller manageable pieces. I will be dealing with Gemifying smaller rack apps, using MongoDB as the back-end database and applying heavy use of javascript and ajax calls in the view layer(s). I intend this to be a learning experience and welcome feedback.</p>
		<h2>What is the Application? What does it do?</h2>
		<p>I will be creating a simple note storing web application.</p>
		<p>A user coming to the website should be able to create new notes, quickly and easily, and in one of many supported markup languages. Also a user should be able to access his collection of notes in a simple and fast manner. After I get this base functionality working we can think about expanding this application into something more useful. Although if we do this right we will already have a collection of small useful apps at our disposal ;)</p>

I will discuss the tools involved, how to get started, and how to inspect and test what we have. This is my approach and I certainly don&#8217;t claim that it is the best. Hopefully we can get some discussion going and we can all learn and improve.</p>
