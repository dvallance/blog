	<h1>Default Naming Conventions of Posts in Jeykll</h1>
	<div class="post-body">
		<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>as I&#8217;m testing different behaviours, changing config settings, etc; I seem to end up in a state where things <strong>stop working</strong> properly. When this happens, the output from Jeykll doesn&#8217;t seem to help me identify what I changed to cause a problem or exactly what the issue is. I strongly suggest you use a source control system, such as git, to be able to revert to a previous working state.</em></p>
		<p>As I stated in my <a href="/blog/getting-started-with-jeykll">first post on Jeykll</a>, I want to understand the naming conventions of posts and figure out how to change them.</p>
		<h2>Default Behaviour</h2>
		<p>It appears that your posts must be named in the following format or they will not function properly.</p>
<pre><code>year-month-day-title.format (e.g. 2012-01-05-my-opinion-on-somthing.textile)</code></pre>
		<p>I really didn&#8217;t want the date in the filename itself, but since you can override it in the <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter"><span class="caps">YAML</span> Front Matter</a> I guess its not that big of a deal (still I dislike it, as the day I actually publish a post is usually not the day I start writing it).</p>
		<h2>Permalinks</h2>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Permalinks">Permalink</a> is the terminology Jeykll uses for how your site&#8217;s URLs are generated.</p>
		<p>There are a few built-in styles to choose from (i.e date, pretty or none) but its very flexible and you can supply your own. I chose to go with <em>/blog/:categories/:title</em> for my posts.</p>
		<p>So in my _config.yml file I added:</p>
<pre>permalink: /blog/:categories/:title</pre>
		<p>The part that is confusing is that the :title is replaced by the title part of the filename and doesn&#8217;t seem to take the :title value from the <span class="caps">YAML</span> Front Matter section. Which I hoped it would. So in other words the :title part of the url is directly tied to the filename and can&#8217;t be changed, unless you change the filename itself.</p>
		<p>So&#8230;</p>
<pre>_posts/2012-03-05-my-cool-article.textile</pre>
		<p>with my permalink setting of&#8230;</p>
<pre>permalink: /blog/:categories/:title</pre>
		<p>and a <span class="caps">YAML</span> Front Matter of&#8230;</p>
<pre>
---
title: New Title Name
categories: [ amazing, technology ]
---</pre>
		<p>produces a final url for that post of&#8230;</p>
<pre>
/blog/amazing/technology/my-cool-article/</pre>
		<h2>What Does Setting the :title Do Then?</h2>
		<p>It comes into play when you want to use <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/template-data">Template Data</a>. When you access the post&#8217;s title via markup, such as <strong><em>{{ post.title }}</em></strong> it will have the &#8220;New Title Name&#8221; as declared above.</p>
		<h2>Continuing</h2>
		<p>I&#8217;m still learning the finer ins and outs of Jeykll so look out for future blogs. Tags and how to use them are still a mystery; that may be my next topic.</p>
